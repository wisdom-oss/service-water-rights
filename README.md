## About
This service allows users to read the water rights that have been parsed using
[nlwkn-rs](https://github.com/wisdom-oss/nlwkn-rs) and its predecessor.
Currently, the service focuses on the predecessor's format and data types.
However, this may be changed in the future.

## Using the service
The service may be accessed using the [api documentation](openapi.yaml).
The service is present on the demonstration system.
However, the service is not included in every standard deployment, due to the
data not being delivered by the service and a required manual crawling process.
